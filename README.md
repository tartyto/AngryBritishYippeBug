# Yippe British Bug mod

I loved the YippeMod by sunnobunno and the Angry British Bug mod by HoffmanTV (both mods links below)

this is an attempt to merge both mods, so when the Hoarding bug is roaming it will say the Yippe sound and when aggroed, the Angry British sound effects will play.
There was barely any effort put into this, all credit goes into the original authors. If it weren't for them, this wouldn't exist
